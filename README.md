# Ex*euŒ¥* VR Unity Toolkit 

Welcome to ExeudVR, helping you to build, host and share immersive experiences on the Internet Computer. This repository - a Unity toolkit - features modules that add dynamic physics, interaction, a rigged body and p2p multiplayer functionality to your Unity scene. Once built, it can be used with the [exeudvr-canister](https://github.com/willguest/exeudvr-canister) repository, to self-host these interactive experience on the bloackchain.

## üì¶ Steps to create a new immersive experience

Make sure that [Unity 2020 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive#download-archive-2020) is installed on your system.

1) Start a new URP project using [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).

2) Import the ExeudVR package, which can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/willguest/ExeudVR/releases). \
*Assets ‚Üí Import Package ‚Üí Custom Package*

3) Open the ExeudVR Setup window. \
*Window ‚Üí WebXR ‚Üí ExeudVR Setup*

4) Use the interface to complete the ExeudVR setup:

   - Switch build target to WebGL.
   - Add dependencies, using the relevant buttons.
   - Click on *Enable ExeudVR* to add enable the toolkit.
   - Apply relevant settings. Note that **this will override your current settings**.

5) Check that WebXR Export is enabled for the WebGL target. \
*Project Settings ‚Üí XR Plug-in Management*

6) Open one of the starter scenes \
*Assets/ExeudVR/Scenes*

7) In the *Build Settings* window, add the current scene, then click *Build*

8) For compatibility with the [canister template](https://github.com/willguest/exeudvr-canister), put the build in a folder called `unity_build`.

## üìÑ Documentation

Each class is documented in a corresponding markdown file, and linked in the class definition summary. The [top level](https://github.com/willguest/ExeudVR/tree/develop/Documentation) contains instructions on how to add documentation to any contributions.


## üåê Self-Hosting

This repository is intended to be used with [exeudvr-canister](https://github.com/willguest/exeudvr-canister), which allows the Unity WebGL builds to be self-hosted on the Internet Computer blockchain. See that repository's README for more information.


## üíõ Sponsorship

The framework is open-source and largely funded by grants from the Internet Computer. I welcome sponsorship in all its forms and look forward to scaling this project as more resources become available. Please visit my [sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/willguest) for more information.
