# Exeud Virtual Reality 

Welcome to the ExeudVR, a Unity-based toolkit for designing cutting-edge immersive experiences on the Internet Computer.


## üì¶ Steps to Create an ExeudVR Experience

Make sure that [Unity 2020 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive#download-archive-2020) is installed on your system.

1) Start a new URP project using [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).

2) Import the ExeudVR package. \
*Assets ‚Üí Import Package ‚Üí Custom Package*

3) Open the ICVR Setup window. \
*Window ‚Üí WebXR ‚Üí ExeudVR Setup*

4) Use the interface to complete the ExeudVR setup:

   - Switch build target to WebGL.
   - Add dependencies, using the relevant buttons.
   - Click on *Enable ExeudVR* to add the `ExeudVR` Scripting Define Symbol.
   - Apply relevant settings. Note that **this will override your current settings**.

5) Check that WebXR Export is enabled for the WebGL target. \
*Project Settings ‚Üí XR Plug-in Management*

6) Open one of the test scenes \
Bare bones: *Assets/ExeudVR/Scenes* \
(https://github.com/willguest/ExeudVR/releases)

7) Open the *Build Settings* window, add the current scene and click *Build*

8) For compatibility with the [exeud-canister](https://github.com/willguest/exeud-canister) template, place the build in a folder called `unity_build`.

## üìÑ Documentation

Each class is documented in a corresponding markdown file, and linked in the class definition summary. The [top level](https://github.com/willguest/ExeudVR/tree/develop/Documentation) contains instructions on how to add documentation to any contributions.

## üåê Self-Hosting

This repository is intended to be used with [exeud-canister](https://github.com/willguest/exeud-canister), which allows the Unity WebGL builds to be self-hosted on the Internet Computer blockchain. See that repository's README for more information.


## üíõ Sponsorship

The framework is open-source and was initially funded by non-dilutive grants from the Internet Computer. I welcome sponsorship in all forms and look forward to scaling this project as more resources become available. Please visit my [sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/willguest) for more information.
