# Ex*euŒ¥*VR Unity Toolkit 

Welcome to ExeudVR, a toolkit to help you to build, host and share immersive experiences on the Internet Computer.

This repository contains modules that add dynamic physics, easy configuration for object interaction, a rigged body, and WebRTC multiplayer functionality to a Unity scene. Once built, it can be used with the [exeudvr-canister](https://github.com/willguest/exeudvr-canister) template, to self-host these interactive experience on the blockchain.
